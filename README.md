## CsPointer

### Introduction

CsPointer is a standalone library which provides multiple smart pointer implementations which extend the functionality
available in the C++ Standard Library.


### System Requirements

To use CsPointer you will need a C++17 compiler and a C++17 standard library.

Currently uses the CMake build system for building and running the unit test suite. The library has been tested with
clang sanitizer and a major code review.

### Documentation

Class level documentation for CsPointer is available on the CopperSpice website.
